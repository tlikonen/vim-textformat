Description
-----------

This [Vim][] plugin provides commands and key mappings to quickly align
and format text. Text can be easily reformatted and aligned to either
left or right margin or justified to both margins or centered. The text
formatting commands provided by this plugin are a bit more automatic and
more intelligent than those integrated to Vim. Together they make more
powerful command set for formatting text.
